## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to this high-caliber venture into the labyrinthine world of cybersecurity with a focus on **Polymorphic Engines**. This project amalgamates the raw power of C++ with the flexibility of Python to provide a truly next-gen educational toolset.

---

## 🤔 Rationale Behind the Project

In an era where paywalls and NDAs have become the toll gates on the knowledge highway, I stand as a proponent of open-source intelligence and free education. This project is not just a set of code files; it's a statement that knowledge should be democratized. 🌍🔓

## 🤖 Understanding Polymorphic Engines

Polymorphic Engines are the epitome of evasion in code representation. They leverage sophisticated techniques to mutate code while preserving its logical sanctity. In simpler terms, the code changes its appearance but not its soul. This project demonstrates these complex transformations using **Instruction Reordering**, **Register Renaming**, and a slew of other mechanisms.

## 🛠️ Project Installation & Setup

### Pre-requisites
- GNU C++ Compiler
- Python 3.x

### Commands
```
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository_url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd <project_directory>

# Compile the C++ files (Windows)
g++ -o calculator Calculator.cpp PolymorphicEngine.cpp

# Run the compiled executable (Windows)
calculator.exe

# Run the Python hash checker script
python hash_checker.py
```

---

## 🎮 User Guide

Execute `calculator.exe` and behold a robust calculator utility that doesn't just perform arithmetic operations. It's a working model of polymorphic code transformation. Feel the power of real-world cybersecurity concepts at your fingertips.(make sure to change the directory to you own)

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Hash Verification Workflow

1. **Initial Compilation**: Use `g++` to compile the calculator project with the polymorphic engine.
2. **Hash Calculation**: Run the Python script `hash_checker.py` to calculate and store the initial hash in a JSON file.
3. **Re-compilation**: Re-compile the calculator project.
4. **Hash Re-calculation**: Execute `hash_checker.py` once more.
5. **Verification**: Open the JSON file and observe a new hash value, confirming the polymorphic nature of the engine.
